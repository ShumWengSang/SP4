		2D gameplay

	Expectation:

		Getting grade B and above

Samuel:

	Prefers:

IDEAS:

	Sars Attack!
		2D Simulation
		Uses money to hire researchers to slow down spread
		Food can get infected, needs to inport food from other
			countries using money

	Defend SG!
		2.5D RTS defence
		Overambitious
		Lots of AI

	Singapura
		Open World 3D (Minecraft)
		Lots of physics

	Typing game
		Runner, speed from Word-by-Minute

	Making profit from Haze scenario
		Sells Masks
		Easy on both coding and textures

	PM Lee hack and slash
		2.5D
		Heavy on sprites and animation

	Chasing Mas Selamat

===========================================================
		

IN FAVOR TO:

	Gas Mask Stall
		Selling point:
			Resource Allocation game (Mind game)

		Pros:
			Easy on coding and textures
		Cons:
			Alot of randomized occurence

		Game States:
			Main menu, new game, save game, load game, game play

		Game Play:
			Game will go for 7 days (exceeds 400 PSI at end)
			Start with $1000
			Forecast not 100% correct (PSI reading)
				Average PSI per day
				PSI may change every second but still averages at AvePSI at the end
			Set price and amount to sell
			Pure simulation thereafter
			End of day, shows profit, gas mask resets to zero, gives player choice of saving and buying mask stocks

		Buyer:
			Randomized values
			Health priority + multiplier depending on haze
			Money priority - multiplier the more expensive
			Time priority

===========================================================

	Sars Attack
		Selling point:
			Defend your nation, be proud of it

		Pros:
			Less on textures

		Cons:
			More on coding
			Background AI
			Timer with random occurence

		Game States:
			Main menu, settings, level selection, gameplay

		Game Play:
			Multiple strains (no difference tentatively) with different tiers, player allocates researchers to research cures
			Use money from taxes to buy researchers. Cure progress may go negative if not enough researchers
			Singapore separated to different areas (N,S,E,W) with smaller parts (Woodlands, Bedok, etc)
			Each smaller areas can only have 1 virus strain
			Areas infected can spread its virus strain to adjacent areas but with a lower tier (eg. From Tier 4 -> Tier 1)
			Use colors to represent each strain
			When an area gets infected from another area by spread, it fades to black before changing into the other color
			Researchers visualized with bar, the number to limit ratio and +/- buttons
			Researchers research on one of the 3 base strains
			GDP tax income (not core: more money when more sick/infected )
			Win Condition: Cure all 3 base strains. 0% infection
			Lose: 100% infection

	WL	Features:
	43		GameStates: Main Menu, settings :	
	10		Textures :				
	72		Color Class:				
			Virus Class <- AI :			
			Researcher Allocation :			
			Money Matter :				
			Win Lose condition :			
			UI :					
			Infection + Infection rate Class :	
			Location Class :			
			Throw Medicine (slows infection) :	
			Sound :					
			Time :					

		Not-core:
			Rate of infection (Advanced Algorithm?)

===========================================================

	PM Lee hack and slash
		Pros:
			2D is easier (probably)
		Cons:
			Lots of sprites needed


REJECTED IDEAS:

	Singapura
